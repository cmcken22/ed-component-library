## Run the repo locally

- install the dependencies

```js
npm install
```

- run storybook

```js
npm run sb
```

<br />
<br />
## Component Structure

- Components have a modular structure, with each component isolated to its own folder.
- Everything pertaining to a component is contained within its folder.
- Each component should contain the following files
  - `index.ts` - The main export file
  - `<ComponentName>.tsx` - The main component file
  - `<ComponentName>.types.ts` - The types file (i.e: prop type definitions, interfaces, etc.)
  - `<ComponentName>.stories.tsx` - The storybook file
  - `<ComponentName>.test.tsx` - The test file
  - `<ComponentName>.theme.ts` - The MUI theme override file (if applicable)

<br />
<br />
## Creating a new component

- To create a new component please use the `generate`
  command
- Replacing `<ComponentName>` with the name of the component you want to create

```js
npm run generate <ComponentName>
```

- This will create a new folder with the component structure and files mentioned above
- Make sure to export your component in the `src/index.ts` file in order for it to be included in the npm package

```js
export { default as Button } from "./Button";
```

- Only the components exported in the `src/index.ts` file will be included in the npm package!!!

<br />
<br />
## Testing the Components with Jest

- We use Jest and React Testing Library for testing component logic
- Each component should have a test file

```js
npm run test
```

- Or to run tests in watch mode

```js
npm run test:watch
```

- The unit tests focus on component logic rather than rendering
- This is because Jest has dificulty access dom styles and testing styles can be very tedious with not much gain
  - Testing if a background color is red is not as important as testing if a function returns the correct value

* For visual testing we can leverage Chromatic - learn more about Chromatic [here](https://www.chromatic.com/)

<br />
<br />
## Testing the Components with Chromatic

- Chromatic is a visual testing & review tool that scans every possible UI state across browsers to catch visual and functional bugs.
- It is integrated with Storybook and creates a visual snapshot of each component story
- Learn more about Chromatic [here](https://www.chromatic.com/)

```js
npm run chromatic
```

- Once the build is complete you can visit the Chromatic dashboard to review the visual snapshots
- Chromatic will spit out the url at the end of the build process
- At the time of writing, the url is [https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=65e7ee0213e9571ce1685faa](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=65e7ee0213e9571ce1685faa)

<br />

## Deploying Storybook to Github Pages

- Storybook can be deployed to Github Pages for easy sharing and review
- To deploy the storybook to Github Pages run the following command

```js
npm run sb:deploy
```

- View the updated storybook at [https://cmcken22.github.io/ed-component-library](https://cmcken22.github.io/ed-component-library/)

## Using Yalc to preview a release

- Before pushing to NPM it is important to test the component in a real world scenario
- We can use Yalc to publish the component to a local registry and then install it in another project
- Doing this will allow us to test the component in another repo before pushing to NPM reducing the likelyhood of publishing bugs

- You need to have `yalc` installed globally

```js
npm install -g yalc
```

- In the package.json file, update the version number for example from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`
  - please follow semantic versioning when updating the version number [docs](https://semver.org/)

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

- Then build the repo to create our dist folder with the minified component files

```js
npm run build
```

- Then run the following command to publish the package to the local `yalc` registry

```js
yalc publish
```

- now navigate to the project you want to test the component in and run the following command

```js
yalc add @cmckenna/ed-component-library@latest
```

- You can now use the repo in the project as if it was installed from NPM

## Publishing to NPM
