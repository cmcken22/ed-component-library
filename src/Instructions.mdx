<br />
## Run the repo locally

- install the dependencies

```js
npm install
```

- run storybook

```js
npm run sb
```

<br />
<br />
## Component Structure

- Components have a modular structure, with each component isolated to its own folder.
- Everything pertaining to a component is contained within its folder.
- Each component should contain the following files
  - `index.ts` - The main export file
  - `<ComponentName>.tsx` - The main component file
  - `<ComponentName>.types.ts` - The types file (i.e: prop type definitions, interfaces, etc.)
  - `<ComponentName>.stories.tsx` - The storybook file
  - `<ComponentName>.test.tsx` - The test file
  - `<ComponentName>.theme.ts` - The MUI theme override file (if applicable)

<br />
<br />
## Creating a new component

- To create a new component please use the `generate`
  command
- Replacing `<ComponentName>` with the name of the component you want to create

```js
npm run generate <ComponentName>
```

- This will create a new folder with the component structure and files mentioned above
- Make sure to export your component in the `src/index.ts` file in order for it to be included in the npm package

```js
export { default as Button } from "./Button";
```

- Only the components exported in the `src/index.ts` file will be included in the npm package!!!

<br />
<br />
## Adding Icons

- To add an icon we need to convert an `svg` file into a `tsx` file
- `svg` files usually have `stroke` and `fill` values set to a hex code, we need to replace all the instances of `fill` and `stroke` with `currentColor`
- this will allow us to easily change the color of the icon using css
- we can use the `convert-svg` script to convert the svg file to a tsx file
- to run the script use the following command

```js
npm run convert-svg <directory_path>
```

- replacing `<directory_path>` with the path to the directory containing the svg files
- the script will iterate over all svg files and convert them into the tsx format
- additionally, it will reformat the file name into a more user-friendly format.
- remember to add the new icons to the IconMap in the `src/Icon/Icon.map.ts` file

**Example:**

```jsx
// Add.svg
<svg
  width="24"
  height="24"
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
  fill="none" // <- we don't want this, it will make it difficult to change the color
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <path
    d="M8 12H12M16 12H12M12 12V8M12 12V16"
    stroke="#2E2E2E" // <- we don't want this, it will make it difficult to change the color
    stroke-width="1.5"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
  />
  <path
    d="M12 22C17.5228 22 22 17.5228 22 12C22 6.47715 17.5228 2 12 2C6.47715 2 2 6.47715 2 12C2 17.5228 6.47715 22 12 22Z"
    stroke="#2E2E2E" // <- we don't want this, it will make it difficult to change the color
    stroke-width="1.5"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
  />
</svg>
```

**will be converted to**

```tsx
// Add.tsx
export default ({ stroke, fill }: { stroke: string; fill: string }) => (
  <svg
    width="24"
    height="24"
    viewBox="0 0 24 24"
    fill={fill} // <- much better
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  >
    <path
      d="M8 12H12M16 12H12M12 12V8M12 12V16"
      stroke={stroke} // <- much better
      strokeWidth="1.5"
      strokeLinecap="round"
      strokeLinejoin="round"
    />
    <path
      d="M12 22C17.5228 22 22 17.5228 22 12C22 6.47715 17.5228 2 12 2C6.47715 2 2 6.47715 2 12C2 17.5228 6.47715 22 12 22Z"
      stroke={stroke} // <- much better
      strokeWidth="1.5"
      strokeLinecap="round"
      strokeLinejoin="round"
    />
  </svg>
);
```

<br />

## Testing the Components with Jest

- We use Jest and React Testing Library for testing component logic
- Each component should have a test file

```js
npm run test
```

- Or to run tests in watch mode

```js
npm run test:watch
```

- The unit tests focus on component logic rather than rendering
- This is because Jest has dificulty access dom styles and testing styles can be very tedious with not much gain
  - Testing if a background color is red is not as important as testing if a function returns the correct value

* For visual testing we can leverage Chromatic - learn more about Chromatic [here](https://www.chromatic.com)

<br />
<br />
## Testing the Components with Chromatic

- Chromatic is a visual testing & review tool that scans every possible UI state across browsers to catch visual and functional bugs.
- It is integrated with Storybook and creates a visual snapshot of each component story
- Learn more about Chromatic [here](https://www.chromatic.com)

```js
npm run chromatic
```

- Once the build is complete you can visit the Chromatic dashboard to review the visual snapshots
- Chromatic will spit out the url at the end of the build process
- At the time of writing, the url is [https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=65e7ee0213e9571ce1685faa](https://www.chromatic.com/builds?appId=65e7ee0213e9571ce1685faa)

<br />
<br />
## Deploying Storybook to Github Pages

- Storybook can be deployed to Github Pages for easy sharing and review
- To deploy the storybook to Github Pages run the following command

```js
npm run sb:deploy
```

- View the updated storybook at [https://cmcken22.github.io/ed-component-library](https://cmcken22.github.io/ed-component-library)

<br />
<br />
## Using Yalc to preview a release

- Before pushing to NPM it is important to test the component in a real world scenario
- We can use Yalc to publish the component to a local registry and then install it in another project
- Doing this will allow us to test the component in another repo before pushing to NPM reducing the likelyhood of publishing bugs

- You need to have `yalc` installed globally

```js
npm install -g yalc
```

- In the package.json file, update the version number for example from `1.0.0` to `2.0.0`
  - please follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) when updating the version number

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.0"
}
```

- Then build the repo to create our dist folder with the minified component files

```js
npm run build
```

- Then run the following command to publish the package to the local `yalc` registry

```js
yalc publish
```

- now navigate to the project you want to test the component in and run the following command

```js
yalc add @cmckenna/ed-component-library
```

- Then run the install again to make sure the dependencies have been installed

```js
npm install
```

- You can now use the repo in the project as if it were installed from NPM

<br />
<br />
## Publishing to NPM

- The `package.json` has been configured to publish to the NPM registry
- First we need to bump the version number in the `package.json` file
  - for example from `2.0.0` to `2.0.1`
  - please follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) when updating the version number

```json
{
  "version": "2.0.1"
}
```

- Then we need to build the package, sign into NPM and publish the package

```js
npm run build
```

```js
npm login
```

```js
npm publish
```

- That's it! The package is now published to NPM and can be installed in any project
